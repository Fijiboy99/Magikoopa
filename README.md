# Magikoopa
Compiles custom code for 3ds games and injects it into existing code.bin files and patches the exheader

Motivation for this is to create a NSMB2 hack with fully custom code. In theory this should work with all other games as well tho.

Work in progress. Should be in a kinda working state now. Might still have bugs that wait to be reported :)

You can find examples on how to use Magikoopa in combination with NSMB2 here: https://github.com/RicBent/Magikoopa-NSMB2-Examples/

### Thanks to

* StapleButter -- Partial coding of the Filesystem classes
